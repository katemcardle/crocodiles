        <h2 id="chapter">Chapter one: August</h2>

        <p>In July my father went to take the waters and left me, with my mother and elder brother, a prey to
            the
            blinding white heat of the summer days. Dizzy with light, we dipped into that enormous book of
            holidays,
            its pages blazing with sunshine and scented with the sweet melting pulp of golden pears.</p>

        <p>On those luminous mornings Adela returned from the market, like Pomona emerging from the flames of
            day,
            spilling from her basket the colourful beauty of the sun — the shiny pink cherries full of juice
            under
            their transparent skins, the mysterious black morellos that smelled so much better than they tasted;
            apricots in whose golden pulp lay the core of long afternoons. And next to that pure poetry of
            fruit,
            she unloaded sides of meat with their keyboard of ribs swollen with energy and strength, and
            seaweeds of
            vegetables like dead octopuses and squids — the raw material of meals with a yet undefined taste,
            the
            vegetative and terrestrial ingredients of dinner, exuding a wild and rustic smell.</p>

        <p>The dark second-floor apartment of the house in Market Square was shot through each day by the naked
            heat
            of summer: the silence of the shimmering streaks of air, the squares of brightness dreaming their
            intense dreams on the floor; the sound of a barrel organ rising from the deepest golden vein of day;
            two
            or three bars of a chorus, played on a distant piano over and over again, melting in the sun on the
            white pavement, lost in the fire of high noon.</p>

        <p>After tidying up, Adela would plunge the rooms into semi-darkness by drawing down the linen blinds.
            All
            colours immediately fell an octave lower, the room filled with shadows, as if it had sunk to the
            bottom
            of the sea and the light was reflected in mirrors of green water — and the heat of the day began to
            breathe on the blinds as they stirred slightly in their daydreams.</p>

    <div class="market">

        <p>On Saturday afternoons I used to go for a walk with my mother. From the dusk of the hallway, we
            stepped
            at once into the brightness of the day. The passers-by, bathed in melting gold, had their eyes half
            closed against the glare, as if they were drenched with honey. Upper lips were drawn back, exposing
            the
            teeth. Everyone in this golden day wore that grimace of heat — as if the sun had forced his
            worshippers
            to wear identical masks of gold. The old and the young, women and children, greeted each other with
            these masks, painted on their faces with thick gold paint; they smiled at each other’s pagan faces —
            the
            barbaric smiles of Bacchus.</p>

        <p>Market Square was empty and white-hot, swept by hot winds like a biblical desert. The thorny acacias,
            growing in this emptiness, looked with their bright leaves like the trees on old tapestries.
            Although
            there was no breath of wind, they rustled their foliage in a theatrical gesture, as if wanting to
            display the elegance of the silver lining of their leaves that resembled the fox-fur lining of a
            nobleman’s coat. The old houses, worn smooth by the winds of innumerable days, played tricks with
            the
            reflections of the atmosphere, with echoes and memories of colours scattered in the depth of the
            cloudless sky. It seemed as if whole generations of summer days, like patient stonemasons cleaning
            the
            mildewed plaster from old facades, had removed the deceptive varnish revealing more and more clearly
            the
            true face of the houses, the features that fate had given them and life had shaped for them from the
            inside. Now the windows, blinded by the glare of the empty square, had fallen asleep; the balconies
            declared their emptiness to heaven; the open doorways smelt of coolness and wine.</p>

        <p>A bunch of ragamuffins, sheltering in a corner of the square from the flaming broom of the heat,
            beleaguered a piece of wall, throwing buttons and coins at it over and over again, as if wishing to
            read
            in the horoscope of those metal discs the real secret written in the hieroglyphics of cracks and
            scratched lines. Apart from them, the square was deserted. One expected that, any minute, the
            Samaritan’s donkey, led by the bridle, would stop in front of the wine merchant’s vaulted doorway
            and
            that two servants would carefully ease a sick man from the red-hot saddle and carry him slowly up
            the
            cool stairs to the floor above, already redolent of the Sabbath.</p>

        <p>Thus my mother and I ambled along the two sunny sides of Market Square, guiding our broken shadows
            along
            the houses as over a keyboard. Under our soft steps the squares of the paving stones slowly filed
            past —
            some the pale pink of human skin, some golden, some blue-grey, all flat, warm and velvety in the
            sun,
            like sundials, trodden to the point of obliteration, into blessed nothingness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="street">
        <p>And finally on the corner of Stryjska Street we passed within the shadow of the chemist’s shop. A
            large
            jar of raspberry juice in the wide window symbolized the coolness of balms which can relieve all
            kinds
            of pain. After we passed a few more houses, the street ceased to maintain any pretence of urbanity,
            like
            a man returning to his little village who, piece by piece, strips off his Sunday best, slowly
            changing
            back into a peasant as he gets closer to his home.</p>

        <p>The suburban houses were sinking, windows and all, into the exuberant tangle of blossom in their
            little
            gardens. Overlooked by the light of day, weeds and wild flowers of all kinds luxuriated quietly,
            glad of
            the interval for dreams beyond the margin of time on the borders of an endless day. An enormous
            sunflower, lifted on a powerful stem and suffering from hypertrophy, clad in the yellow mourning of
            the
            last sorrowful days of its life, bent under the weight of its monstrous girth. But the naive
            suburban
            bluebells and unpretentious dimity flowers stood helpless in their starched pink and white shifts,
            indifferent to the sunflower’s tragedy.</p>

    <div class="about">
            <h2 id="about">About the author</h2>
            <p>Born in 1892, Schulz's literary career was marked by his two major works, "The Street of Crocodiles"
                and "Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass," both of which highlight his unique style
                characterised by rich imagery and intricate metaphors. His writings reflect a deep sense of
                nostalgia and an uncanny ability to capture the complexities of human emotion and memory.</p>
            <p>In addition to his literary contributions, Schulz was a talented visual artist, illustrating his own
                works and creating remarkable paintings that complemented his narratives. Tragically, his life was
                cut short during the Holocaust, but his legacy endures, influencing countless writers and artists
                with his imaginative storytelling and profound exploration of identity and memory.</p>
